            <h1>RE:AMANDA WILLIAMS <br>SCHOOL APPLICATION</h1>
            <p1>Dear Amanda, <br>
                We appreciate your recent application to join us at the science faculty of the 
                University of Luck to pursue your PhD next year. I'll address each of your inquiries 
                one at a time in the parts that follow.</p1>
            
             <h2>Starting dates</h2>
             <p2>However, it would be more convenient for us if you could begin your studies with us <br>
                at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each semester are as follows: <br>
                ● First semester: 19 October 2017 <br>
                ● Second semester: 21 February 2018 <br>
                ● Third semester: 14 June 2017 <br>
                If this is okay with you, just let me know the start date you would want. <br>
                On our <a href="https://www.google.com">website</a>, you can get additional details regarding significant university dates. <br>
            </p2>
